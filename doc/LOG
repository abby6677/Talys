Development of TALYS since release of TALYS-1.95

- December 30, 2019

********** Release of TALYS-1.95 **********

- January 4, 2020

Added keyword 'soukho' to allow disabling of Soukhovitskii OMP for 
actinides. Now parameters relative to KD03 can be given.

- January 16, 2020

Implemented Okumura model for fission yields and subsequent particle 
evaporation for fission neutrons. Keyword fymodel has been extended 
with option '4' for this model. Also added fymodel 5 which allows to 
enter FF population tables.

- February 5, 2020

Introduced keyword 'yieldfile' to allow input of fission fragment 
yields per pair, and their respective TXE and TKE values. This serves 
as input for the Okumura model to evaporate each excited fission 
fragment individually.

- March 2, 2020

Improved the calculation for a populated nucleus, needed after tests 
done with Toshihiko Kawano on the depletion of fission products. The 
flux of the populated nucleus is now better mapped onto the decay 
scheme. Subroutine excitation.f was changed for that. The number of 
energy bins can now also be equal to 1, for one starting excited level.

- March 23, 2020

Changed the default to 'equidistant y' after binning problems observed 
by Sandor Sudar at high energy proton reactions.

- March 27, 2020

Added keyword gadjust as 1-component version of gnadjust and gpadjust. 
This can be used for consistent variation of gn and gp for the 
2-component exciton model.

- May 24, 2020

Removed a bug in the reading of an external, tabulated optical model 
file. The first line of that file should contain Z, A, number of lines 
and (optional) Fermi energy. This did not hurt the sample case for 
n + U238 which is why the error got unnoticed for so long.

- May 27, 2020

TALYS can now read RIPL OMP, which is for sure necessary for actinides 
and probably helpful for other cases as well. The initial version has 
been tested for important actinides.

- May 31, 2020

Extended isospin forbidden transitions for multiple emission using 
'fisom' keyword on advice of Stephane Goriely.

- Aug 17, 2020

Reprogrammed the isospin transition cases by making a new subroutine 
isotrans.f.

- Sep 27, 2020

Improved the output of level densities after suggestions by 
Khashane Malatji: the total parity-dependent level densities were not 
properly tabulated. Made a new subroutine densitytotP for this, which 
only affects the level density output, not the reaction calculations.

- Oct 19, 2020

On the advice of Jean-Francois Lemaire, revised various subroutines for 
the FY and PFNS calculations, There was an error in the CM to LAB 
integration boundaries and the FY and spin distribution normalizations.

- Dec 22, 2020

Added a 'block' keyword to write large amount of output data in output 
blocks instead of individual files. With 'block n' the old situation is 
retained: All spectra, angular distributions etc are stored in an 
individual file per incident energy. We use 'block y' now to create 
ENDF files, as it does not produce a huge amount of files.

- Feb 1, 2021

Corrected more coding on FY, PFNS and nubar etc. in massdis.f and 
ffevap.f on the advice of Jean-Francois Lemaire.

- Feb 15, 2021

Include Marilena Avrigeanu's deuteron break-up model. For this, 
the structure/ database was extended with the TENDL neutron and 
protons cross sections.

- March 1, 2021

Corrected pre-neutron FY table on advice of Ali Al-Adili. Also added 
average gamma and neutron energy per FF in the output.

- April 26, 2021

Changed the default for subactinide fission. Now fismodel 3 is used for
charged-particle induced reactions on all targets and for neutrons
on subactinides, which gives a dramatic improvement of the fission 
cross sections.

- April 28, 2021

Added the option to read in fission fragment distributions from the 
structure database, after the provision of FF distributions from 
Ali Al-Adili and Fredrik Nordstroem.
Added the keyword 'ffmodel' to chose between models of FF distribution.

- June 6, 2021

Updated the resonance parameter files in talys/structure/resfiles.
Now resonance parameters can be read for tendl.2019 (default), 
endfb8.0, jeff3.3, cendl3.2 and jendl4.0.

- July 13, 2021

Changed default parameters for break-up reactions for (d,p) and 
stripping reactions for (alpha,n) to improve the global quality
of the cross section fits. This extra adjustment is done at the top of 
breakup.f.

- August 23, 2021

Added a subroutine for Wahl systematics for nubar, which is now 
written to output by TALYS also without an explicit FF to FY 
calculation. Separated some of the calculation of nubar for total 
and nu(A) for that in nudisout.f and nubarout.f. Made keywords
Cnubar1 and Cnubar2 to alter systematic value for nubar.

- August 27, 2021

Extended the input possibilities for all keywords for which a Z,A
combination needs to be given. Besides the real Z,A of the nucleus,
also the Z,A relative to the compound nucleus can be given as index.
E.g., for the reaction n + Nb93, the keyword+value 
'aadjust 41 93 1.10' can also be given as 'aadjust 0 1 1.10'
This only works for Z,A inside the values 2,4 of the compound nucleus.

- September 1, 2021

Enabled the reading in of so called wtable parameters to change the
width of tabulated photon-strength functions. 

- September 6, 2021

Changed the default in TALYS for photon strength functions after 
testing with Stephane Goriely. The default is now strength 9 (SMLO),
strengthm1 3 with 'upbend y'. This is applied for all incident 
particles, improving the default prediction for (n,g), (g,n), (p,g),
(a,g) considerably. Automatic wtable parameters are read in for 
adjustment to capture cross sections in the fast neutron range.

- September 9, 2021

Added new keyword 'ldmodelCN' to assign a particular level density
model to the compound nucleus only. So e.g. ldmodelCN 1 and ldmodel 2,
simultaneously in the input file will use CTM for the CN and BFM for 
all other nuclides in the calculation. The same can be achieved by e.g.
ldmodel 1 26 57   and ldmodel 2, but the new option avoids having to
specify the Z,A of the compound nucleus.

- September 28, 2021

Added keywords 'ngfit', 'nnfit', 'nafit', by default disabled, 
to use fitted nuclear model parameters. If 'best y' then 
'ngfit y' by default.

- November 4, 2021

Added Iwamoto model for PFNS, which is a variant of the Los Alamos 
model. Added the keyword 'pfnsmodel' to enable it instead of PFNS coming 
from explicit FF evaporation. Also added the keywords 'Tmadjust' and 
'Fsadjust' to adjust the temperature and number of scission neutrons 
in this model.

- December 29, 2021

Added keywords vfiscoradjust and betafiscoradjust to enable changes 
relative to vfiscor and betafiscor.
