{\bf Fission cross sections: n + ${}^{232}$Th}\newline
It is well known that a systematic approach for fission is difficult to achieve.
It is possible to obtain
very satisfactory fits to fission data with TALYS, but at the expense of using
many adjustable input parameters.
We are performing extensive model calculations to bring somewhat more structure
in the collection of fitting parameters. In the meantime, we include here a
sample case for the description of the fission cross section of $^{232}$Th.
We use the following input file,

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Th232-fis/org/talys.inp}

Note that, although no adjustable parameters are visible above,
this is certainly no ``default'' calculation.
Instead, this sample case illustrates the use of so-called ``best files''.
By using the {\bf best y} keyword, the file
{\em talys/structure/best/Th232/n-Th232.talys} is automatically invoked.
The contents of that file are

\VerbatimInput{/Users/koning/talys/structure/best/Th232/n-Th232.talys}

The above parameters are the usual ones to be adjusted to get good
agreement with experimental data: level density and fission parameters for
the ground state or on top of the barriers.
The resulting file {\em fission.tot} is plotted
together with experimental data in Fig.~\ref{fissioneps}.

Due to the presence of {\bf outfission y} in the input file, all nuclear
structure related to the fission process is given in the output for the target
and the compound nucleus

The fission information for all residual nuclides can be obtained in the
output file as well by adding {\em outpopulation y} to the input file.

As an exercise, the user may want to try to adjust the first fission barrier
of $^{232}$Th to get a better fit of the second chance fission cross section.
