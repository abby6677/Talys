{\bf Fission yields for ${}^{238}$U}\newline

In this sample case we compute fission fragment/product mass/isotope yields.
The fission fragment mass yield curve is determined for neutrons on $^{238}$U 
at incident energies of 1.6 and 5.5 MeV (these incident energies are given 
in the file {\em energies}). The following input file is used:

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-U238-fy/org/talys.inp}

The long list of adjustable parameters, not visible here but automatically 
taken from 
{\em talys/structure/best/U238/z092a238n.best} through the {\bf best y} keyword,
is mainly needed to give a decent (though not yet perfect) description of the 
total fission cross section.
For completeness, we show the results for ${}^{238}$U we obtained 
for incident energies of 1, 1.6, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5 and 10 MeV.
The TALYS results for the pre-neutron emission mass yields can be found in
{\em yield001.600.fis} and {\em yield005.500.fis} and are given in the
upper plot of Fig.~\ref{u238mass}.
The two other plots show a comparison of the normalized yields with
experimental data ~\cite{Vives2000}.

Since we have added the keyword {\em ffevaporation y} to the input,
we have also calculated the fission product isotope yields.
Fig.~\ref{u238iso} contains the result for the production of the fission
products $^{115}$Cd and $^{140}$Ba. The left plot shows the cumulative
yield (obtained after adding the calculated independent yields of all
beta-decay precursors). The normalized cumulative yields are compared to
experimental data \cite{Nagy1978,Chapman1978} in the other two plots.
